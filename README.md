# Group-Project 

While training to be a Data Analyst I was involved in a group project 
where my role was to help create a Financial Advisor Management System
that connects to a MySQL database that we had created.

in this folder there is a text file that contains all the information
to create the MySQL Database and populate it with dummy data.

there is also a brief powerpoint presentation breaking down what was done.

the python file of the management system is still a work in progress,
overall it is working with a few kinks left to work out (figuring out to have 
the login work with the default admins that have no passwords etc)

and finally there is a Power BI file that we created the dashboards to help
break down the data from our dummy database.
